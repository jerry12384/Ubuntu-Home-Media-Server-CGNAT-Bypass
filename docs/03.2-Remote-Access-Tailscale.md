# 3.2 Remote Access Solution: Tailscale (CGNAT Bypass)

Since Port Forwarding failed due to CGNAT [1](https://github.com/jerry12384/Ubuntu-Home-Media-Server-CGNAT-Bypass/blob/main/docs/03-Remote-Access-Attempts%3A%20The-Journey-from-Failure-to-Success.md) , Tailscale was implemented as the zero-configuration mesh VPN solution.

### 3.2.1.  **Tailscale Installation:** Installed the package on the Ubuntu server.

    ```bash
    # Installation commands executed successfully
    sudo tailscale up
    ```

2.  **Authorization:** Used the command prompt link to authenticate the server to the Tailscale network (Tailnet).

3.  **Client Integration:** Installed the Tailscale app on all remote client devices (mobile, laptop) and logged in with the same account.

4.  **Remote Access Success:** The server was assigned a private Tailscale IP (e.g., `100.x.y.z`). Remote devices can now securely access Jellyfin without relying on the public internet connection's Port Forwarding:

    $$\text{Jellyfin Access: http://100.x.y.z:8096}$$

This final solution provided a stable, secure, and zero-maintenance connection for accessing the home server from anywhere.
